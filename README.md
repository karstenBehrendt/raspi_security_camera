Security Camera with web interface

The special thing about this tool is that it works in real-time, stores videos including frames before deteced motion and motion detection is based on 'motion'. The real fun part: Full HD 25fps, stable with web interface. Any pi with raspicam can now be a fully functioning security IP cam.
